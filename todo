BE:-
User can spam send requests after request rejection.
Implement pagination for messages

FE:-
useffect in /login, /register to redirect if already logged in.
Revise redux, store and actions, how it is implemented.
Scrolling pagination for messages
Do not send messages using socket.io, use REST API, let server emit it in real time(will be easier and probably efficient sending files).

(BUG):-

(NOTE):-
Slow response as mongodb atlas taking too long to save messages
Online idicator does not go offline when user logs out because SrictMode creates 2 socketIds
